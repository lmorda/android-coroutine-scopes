# android-coroutine-scopes

This very basic project illustrates the differences between commonly used Coroutine scopes in Android development.  The following scopes will be used:

* GlobalScope - dispatches onto IO thread, very difficult to cancel leading to memory leaks
* CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO) - dispatches onto IO thread, and also memory leaky
* lifecycleScope - dispatches onto main thread but main thread safe if calling suspend function
* viewModelScope - similar to lifecycleScope, observe the ViewModel LiveData result in Activity

The sample should showcase that the ideal solution is to use a combination of viewModelScope and LiveData.  This gives us the Android built-in support
for coroutine cancellation when the ViewModel onCleared function is called which prevents leaking the coroutine.  And combined with LiveData
we have a perfect way to observe and display the result of the coroutine function in the Activity/Fragment on the main thread in a Lifecycle friendly manner.

## Glossary
* Scope - reference to a context so that coroutine builder (launch, async) knows context
* Context - describes the environment of a coroutine (Job, Dispatcher, and coroutine name)
* Job - responsible for coroutineâ€™s lifecycle, cancellation, and parent-child relations
* launch - coroutine builder which launches a coroutine in a scope
* withContext - calls suspending block, suspends until complete and then returns result
